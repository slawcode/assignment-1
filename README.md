- People with disabilities using web assistive devices can access this website.
- Increasing the accessibility of the website will also help business for this marketing agency. Since the website is more accessible it will rank higher in search engines. 
- Through the refactoring of code I learned the importance of making a website accessible for everyone and how helpful HTML image alt attribute descriptors can be for those using assistive technologies. 

## Usage
